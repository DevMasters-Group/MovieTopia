# MovieTopia
MovieTopia is a cinema control management system for scheduling movies and selling tickets to customers. This was our team's deliverable project for the Systems Analysis and Design II module at North West University.

## Setup
Upon cloning or pulling the repository, create a `.env` file in the project's root. The `.env.example` has been provided as a guideline for the variables that must be configured.
The database connection details can be found in the SQL Server Management Studio by right-clicking on the database, selecting properties, and then navigating to "View connection properties" on the right-hand panel. The server name will be under the "Product" drop-down.
